My goal is to explore this question:

http://mathoverflow.net/questions/226422/does-the-mandelbrot-set-have-infinite-vc-dimension

Specifically, I'm going to search to see if I can shatter sets numerically, and thus put lower bounds on the above question.
I also seek to parameterize isometries of the complex plane and render said space, with regions divided by the induced labeling.
